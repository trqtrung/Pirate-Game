# Pirate-Game
Java Game

# This Game is RPG Game.

It's just a practice before make a big game without engine (such as UNITY, UNREAL, ...).
Why is Java? 
  1 - Java is a good object oriented programming.
  2 - We can compile it with every platform supported by JVM (windows, linux, mac os).
  3 - Java has libraries to make a game, etc.

I made this game after saw videos on CodeNMore channel (Youtube).
I hope this is a good example for you guys who wanna make a game without engine.

Note: I use IDE via Eclipse, you can use another IDE.
